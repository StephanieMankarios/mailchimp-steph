      <h2 class="section-title text-center"><strong>You Have 36 525 Days To Live</strong></h2>

      <spacer size="10"></spacer>

      <h5>*|IF:FNAME|*Hey *|TITLE:FNAME|* *|ELSE:|*Hey*|END:IF|*!</h5>

      <p>In my early twenties, I attended Toast Masters (an international organization aimed at helping people develop their communication and leadership skills), where I met a great friend. </p>


      <p>This friend always had a lesson for me: <strong>LIVE LIFE TO THE FULLEST.</strong> </p>


      <p>He used to tell me "If you live to be 100 years old, that means that you will have 36 525 days to live on this earth."
        </p>

      <p>That doesn't seem like much right? </p>

      <p>According to statista, the average life expectancy in North America is 77 years for males, and 81 years for females.
        </p>

      <p>That's only 28 124 days for men, and 29 585 days for women. </p>

      <p>What is the point of knowing this? Well friend, I want to enthusiastically encourage you to live your life with MEANING.
        </p>

      <p>Life is too short to be doing anything other than what makes your heart feel whole. </p>

      <p>Is it really worth it to be living a half-lived-life? </p>

      <p>Everyone's definition of living to the fullest will look different. </p>

      <p>For some, it might mean to live life in an adventurous way, travelling, exploring, taking risks, having fun. </p>

      <p>For others it might mean to have 3 kids and be dedicated to giving them the best childhood possible. </p>

      <p>For others it might mean to build schools and hospitals and spread awareness about a cause they feel strongly about.
        </p>

      <p>And for another, it might mean to become an excellent chef and give people a gustatory experience of a lifetime. </p>


      <p>What have you ALWAYS wanted to do, but have pushed aside because : it's too scary, too expensive, you're too busy,
        there are too many responsibilities, etc? </p>

      <p><strong>NOW</strong> is the time. Yes, NOW! </p>

      <p>If not now, when? </p>

      <p>Let's not fall into the trap of " when I finish school, when I have more money, when the kids move out, when I feel
        better, when I retire, when there's no time." </p>

      <p>There will always be a reason not to follow what our heart desires most. </p>

      <p>I invite you to write a list, of all the things you would like to be/have/do/experience. </p>

      <p>Stick this list in your bedroom or somewhere where you will see it several times a day. </p>

      <p>Begin to visualize yourself ALREADY living/doing/having/being those things. </p>

      <p>Experience the sensations of what it feels like, what it looks like, what it tastes like. </p>

      <p>Begin to live as if you are already there. </p>

      <p>VISUALIZATION my friends, is a very powerful tool. </p>


      <p>Do this for <strong>you.</strong> </p>

      <p>You deserve to live your life to the <strong>FULLEST.</strong> </p>
